--Author: Keila Estrada
-- This project evaluates Kickstarter data to assess project success rates, average funding performance, and category-level risk.
-- The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for better allocation of funding based on success patterns and performance indicators.

-- ===========================================
-- 1. General Overview of Dataset
-- ===========================================

SELECT * 
FROM kickstart_projects


--Based on the data table, the column main category seems to be the most refined, so I will base most of my data off that--
--There are other various sub categories, that have the potential to be evaluated later on.--

--I will be reviewing the total count of projects based on main category--

-- ===========================================
-- 2. Total Projects by Main Category
-- ===========================================

SELECT main_category, COUNT(*) AS total_projects
FROM kickstart_projects
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY total_projects DESC;

-- Film &amp; Video has the highest number of projects, making it the most popular main category by volume.--
--Let's run a table to determine what are the most popular sub categories within this project category--

-- ===========================================
-- 3. Subcategories in Film &amp; Video
-- ===========================================

SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_projects
FROM kickstart_projects
WHERE main_category = 'Film &amp; Video'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_projects DESC;

--After running this report, Documentaries are the most popular projects within the Film &amp; Video category--
--We will use this to review later--

--Let's see how many of the main category projects were successful--

-- ===========================================
-- 4. Successful Projects by Main Category
-- ===========================================

SELECT main_category, COUNT(*) AS successful_projects
FROM kickstart_projects
WHERE state = 'successful'
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY successful_projects DESC;

--Based on the data, the Music category had the most successful projects, with Film &amp; Video coming in second--
--Let's see which music sub categories had the most successful projects--

-- ===========================================
-- 5. Successful Music Subcategories
-- ===========================================

SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS successful_projects
FROM kickstart_projects
WHERE state = 'successful' and main_category = 'Music'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY successful_projects DESC;

--Although some sumbategories were listed as music as well, the second highest to this was Indie Rock. This can be a recommendation for future bookkeeping, to be more precise on how subcategories are entered to have more precise data--

--Lets determine the success rate for each main category--

-- ===========================================
-- 6. Success Rate by Main Category
-- ===========================================

SELECT main_category, COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_projects,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percent
FROM kickstart_projects
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY success_rate_percent DESC;

--Based on the data, Dance had the highest success rate at 62.25 --

--I want to look at the projects and their average funding percentage earned--

-- ===========================================
-- 7. Average Funding Percentage by Category
-- ===========================================
SELECT 
  main_category,
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  ROUND(AVG(pledged * 100.0 / goal), 0) AS avg_funding_percent
FROM kickstart_projects
WHERE goal &gt; 0 AND pledged IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY avg_funding_percent DESC;

--Based on this data although Dance had the highest success rate, it is not listed as the top 5 when it comes to average funding earned--

--By reviewing the number of backers, Film &amp; Video also had the most backers for projects--

-- ===========================================
-- 8. Total Backers by Main Category
-- ===========================================

SELECT main_category, SUM(backers) AS total_backers
FROM kickstart_projects
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY total_backers DESC;

--Let's compare the success rate versus the average funding percentage--

-- ===========================================
-- 9. Success Rate vs. Funding Percent
-- ===========================================

SELECT 
  main_category,
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percent,
  ROUND(AVG(pledged * 100.0 / goal), 2) AS avg_funding_percent
FROM kickstart_projects
WHERE goal &gt; 0 AND pledged IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY success_rate_percent DESC;

-- This query compares success rate and average funding percentage.
-- Categories with high success rates but low average funding might be underfunded relative to their potential.
-- Conversely, high average funding with low success could suggest inefficiency or project bloat.

--Let's explore the failed and canceled projects--

-- ===========================================
-- 10. Failed &amp; Canceled Projects by Category
-- ===========================================

SELECT main_category,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_projects,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'canceled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS canceled_projects
FROM kickstart_projects
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY failed_projects DESC;

-- This demonstrates that some of the funding for these particular categories should be considered, as there is a risk of these projects being cancelled or failed--

-- ===========================================
-- Conclusion and Recommendations
-- ===========================================

-- Based on the analysis:
-- - Film &amp; Video has the most projects and backers, but not the highest success rate.
-- - Dance, though less common, has the highest success rate and deserves more funding consideration.
-- - Music and Games also show strong success in subcategories like Indie Rock and Tabletop Games.
-- - Categories like Film &amp; Video and Publishing show higher failure and cancellation risk, suggesting a need for more cautious investment.

-- Recommendation:
-- Reallocate a portion of funding from historically low-performing categories to those with high success rates but lower average funding,
-- such as Dance or specific subcategories within Music and Film &amp; Video.
