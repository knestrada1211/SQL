SQL Data Projects by Keila Estrada
Welcome! This repository contains two exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects written in SQL that demonstrate my ability to extract insights, evaluate trends, and develop data-driven recommendations using real-world datasets.

Project 1: Kickstarter Projects Analysis
Goal:
Analyze Kickstarter campaigns to determine success rates, funding performance, and risks across different categories. This project is designed to support smarter funding allocation by identifying high-performing and high-risk segments.

Key Questions Answered:

Which project categories and subcategories are most common?

Which categories have the highest success rates?

What are the average funding percentages across categories?

Where is there the most risk of project failure or cancellation?

Key Findings:

🎬 Film & Video had the highest number of total projects and backers.

💃 Dance had the highest success rate (~62%) but is underfunded on average.

🎵 Music and Games show strong performance in subcategories like Indie Rock and Tabletop Games.

📚 Categories like Publishing and Film & Video also show a higher risk of failure/cancellation.

Recommendation:
Funders should consider shifting resources toward categories with high success rates but lower funding—like Dance or certain Music subgenres—to improve overall return on investment and reduce funding risk.

🤖 Project 2: AI Job Trends & Labor Market Analysis
Goal:
Examine how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is influencing the job market—both in terms of projected growth and automation risk across industries. Also evaluates how job education level, salary, and remote work flexibility intersect with AI disruption.

Key Questions Answered:

Which industries are growing or shrinking by 2030?

What roles are most at risk of automation?

Does education level protect against AI impact?

How do AI risk levels align with salary and remote flexibility?

Key Findings:

📈 IT and Healthcare industries are expected to grow the most by 2030.

💸 High-paying roles often have high AI risk—especially in Finance and Admin Services.

🎓 Jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree or higher tend to have lower AI disruption.

🧑‍🏫 Education and Entertainment have the lowest AI impact, but Education is projected to decline in total jobs.

🌎 Remote work flexibility is highest in Manufacturing and Healthcare, despite common assumptions.

Recommendation:
Job seekers and organizations should invest in higher education and reskilling to move toward roles with lower automation risk. Policymakers and educators should monitor at-risk industries to support transition planning.
